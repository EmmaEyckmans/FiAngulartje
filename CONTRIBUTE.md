##Fork this repo

Fork it baby!

##Never forget...

* To sync with master before starting on a new issue/feature. (with `git pull --rebase upstream master`)
* To rebase your commits into one before submitting pull requests.
* To have fun!

##Setting up your environment
1. Install [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/), which you'll need for [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/).
2. After cloning your forked repo, run the following commands
````
  sudo npm install -g yo
  sudo npm install -g generator-angular
  sudo npm install
  bower install
  grunt serve
````
3. Your default browser should have popped up with a working initial screen of the application. 

##Suggestions
You might want to install the [AngularJS](https://github.com/angular-ui/AngularJS-sublime-package) package if you're using SublimeText
